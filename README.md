# GMod Star Wars RP Helix Schema

This repository contains a Helix schema for a Garry's Mod Star Wars Roleplay (RP) server. It's released as-is, without support. Users should use this schema at their own risk.

## Compatibility

While this schema is operational and designed to be used with the WiltOS Renegade Squad System, it may function without it. However, adjustments might be necessary to achieve optimal performance without the WiltOS system.

## Performance and Use

The schema is currently unoptimized. It is not recommended to use it as is for a live server. Instead, consider extracting useful code snippets or patterns as examples for what to do (or not to do) in your projects.

## Credits and Background

Created for my own server, which has since been discontinued, this schema utilizes code and plugins from more experienced developers. Credits can be found within the respective plugin files and, where applicable, in the code itself.

This schema is not a derivative of the HL2rp Schema by Eon but includes code from it. For an example of a high-quality schema, check out [Eon's HL2rp Schema](https://github.com/bloodycop7/ixehl2rp).

## Disclaimer

This schema is provided 'as-is'. I will not provide support for it. It's meant for educational purposes or as a base for further development, rather than direct use in its current state.
