# GMod Star Wars RP Helix Schema

This repository contains a Helix schema for a Garry's Mod Star Wars Roleplay (RP) server. It's released as-is, without support. Users should use this schema at their own risk.

## Compatibility
This is a Helix schema, therefor you need the helix gamemode to use it. Which you can find [here.](https://gethelix.co/).

While this schema is operational and designed to be used with the WiltOS Renegade Squad System, it should function without it. However, adjustments might be necessary to make it work perfectly without it.
The character creation system uses these [models.](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2899560046).

## Performance and Use

The schema is very unoptimized with decisions I've made that still baffles me to this day. It is not recommended to use it as is for a live server. Instead, consider extracting useful code snippets or patterns as examples for what to do (or not to do) in your projects.
Most likely insecure as well, as I had no idea what I was doing with the netmessages. Especially, the character creations networking isn't good, and should be reworked before used.

## Credits and Background

Created for my own server, which has since been discontinued, this schema utilizes code and plugins from far more experienced developers. Credits can be found within the respective plugin files and, where applicable, in the code itself.

## Special Mention

This schema is not a derivative of the HL2rp Schema by Eon but includes code from it. For an example of a high-quality schema, check out his, which can be found here: [Eon's HL2rp Schema](https://github.com/bloodycop7/ixehl2rp).

## Disclaimer

This schema is provided 'as-is'. I will not provide support for it. It's meant for educational purposes or as a base for further development, rather than direct use in its current state.
